### Guggy Button To GIF

Our SDKs & API contain the `createGug` method which receives a text and returns a generated GIF.

Use this method to automatically create the GIF from the user's text (without a preview)

### Previewing background GIF

Call the `onType` method which receives a text and returns the background GIF. *(Currently Available in JS only)*

Use this method to show the user a preview of the result as he is typing the text message.
